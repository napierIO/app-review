        <h2 class="section__title">Initial Assessment:</h2>
        <p class="section__description">A largely-populated news and information app, covering topics such as science, tech, military, lifestyle, social trends and more. Simply put... it seems TI has an article for just about everything worth knowing.</p>
        <h3 class="section__subtitle">Introduction</h3>

        <h2 class="section__title">Features:</h2>
        <p class="section__description">A child-project of Business Insider covering topics ranging from Science and Technology to lifestyle and social trends. Simply put... it seems they have an article for just about everything worth knowing.</p>
        <h3 class="section__subtitle">User-Friendly Menu</h3>
        <div class="section--feature">
            <p class="section__subdescription">This isn’t your typical dropdown menu. This one has clean lines, good use of color. The menu also slides down to overlay the full screen, which is great for my hoof thumbs! No longer will you tap the wrong link. There’s also a Saved Articles
                section, but we’ll get to that a little later.</p>

        <div class="section--feature">
            <p class="section__subdescription">This is a simple, effective, search field. Notice, that I said “field” and not “bar”. It is a subtle, but incredibly refreshing to get away form the plain, boring search bar. A background color --beyond white-- would be nice, but we’ll let
                it slide on the basis of functionality.</p>
